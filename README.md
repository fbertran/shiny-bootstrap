# shiny-bootstrap

This app is a `shiny` visualisation of bootstrapping. It implements two text fields, one for X, one for Y, so the user can paste in their own content.

It then allows the user to try out different amounts of bootstrapping resampling, to see how this affects the distribution of three estimators: correlation coefficient, mean, and standard deviation.

To run, clone this repository and run it in R studio.
